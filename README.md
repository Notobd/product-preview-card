## My process

I started by building with HTML and then moved on to CSS and made it responsive using media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I majorly want to focus on getting better with flex box and hopefully start using grid as well.
